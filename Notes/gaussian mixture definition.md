The point is that you can distort the standard Gaussian to get $X$; one illuminating example is as follows:

### multivariate case
One reasonable way to extend this definition to the multivariate case is to say that a random vector $X$ is a centered Gaussian mixture if there's a random matrix $A$ and a standard Gaussian vector $Z$ such that $X = AZ$.
