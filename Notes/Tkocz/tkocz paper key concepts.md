[[gaussian mixture definition]]

[[Feller 2-2 - Bernstein polynomials]] leading into the prerequisite [[Completely monotone functions and inversion formulas#the most important theorem in the world (in these notes)|theorem]] required to prove [[theorem 2 in tkocz paper|Theorem 2]] in the paper

Sections: 
1) Khinchine-type inequalities: The [[Khinchine inequality|classic result]] and variants depending on the random variables in question give rise to the results in the rest of the paper 
	1) [[Schur majorization]] and its corresponding nice theorem: ![[Pasted image 20230612213051.png]]
	2) This leads to the result of the previous paper, giving a result for uniform r.v.s: ![[Pasted image 20230612213138.png]]
		1) There are notes and photos you have detailing these steps
	3) Theorem 3, one of the main results of the paper (sniped!!! ugh)![[Pasted image 20230612223730.png]]
	4) Proof: uses ![[Pasted image 20230612223747.png]]
	5) At this point you should see [[proof of theorem 3]] and [[corollary 25 following theorem 3]]
